# ABSTRACT: Stage-based conveyor-belt-like ticket handling system

sub run {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::run(@_);

      qr/no stage class name found for \[foobar\]/,
      'make a stage object for a nonexistent stage';

    # We release the cache for stage class names here. The bug which prompted
    # this is a bit involved. We ran all inline pod tests - via
    # 00podtests.t -, and this test ran first, so $env was of ref
    # Data::Conveyor::Environment. The above code calls
    # make_stage_object(), which indirectly caches the stage class name
    # results, so only ST_TXSEL is cached - since that's the only thing
    # defined in the environment's STAGE_CLASS_NAME_HASH().
    #
    # The next test (from another pod test file) used the config file
    # mechanism, which pointed to a config file from a different package,
    # and that config file uses a different environment. However, the
    # settings from that environment weren't seen because of the cached.
