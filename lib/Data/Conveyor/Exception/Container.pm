    # Add the status only for exceptions that have an rc that's equal to the
    # ticket's rc -- assuming the ticket's rc has been calculated before, of
    # course. For an explanation, assume the following situation:
    #
    # A ticket has recorded two exceptions: One with RC_OK and TS_HOLD, the
    # other with RC_ERROR and TS_RUNNING. If we just added rc's and stati
    # independently of each other, we'd end up with RC_ERROR and TS_HOLD. This
    # is not what we want. The ticket should go on hold -- for manual
    # inspection -- only if there weren't more serious issues. After all, we
    # don't want to waste a person's time only to later declare that the
    # ticket has serious problems anyway and to abort processing.
    #
    # What we want to end up with in the above situation is RC_ERROR and
    # TS_RUNNING so that the ticket is aborted. We do this by applying the
    # stati of only those exceptions that caused the ticket's overall rc.
    #
    # In our example, that's the exception that caused the RC_ERROR. Since
    # that exception has TS_RUNNING, that's the status we end up with. Which
    # is nice.

# Transactions ask their item (which asks their exception container) whether
# it has problematic exceptions that should cause the transaction's status to
# be set to $self->delegate->TXS_ERROR. See Data::Conveyor::Ticket::Transaction.
#
# Ordinarily, exceptions with an rc of RC_ERROR or RC_INTERNAL_ERROR are
# considered problematic. The exception's status can also have an effect on
# the tx's status. For example, in NICAT, an ::Onwait exception will have
# RC_OK and TS_HOLD, which should leave the tx on TXS_RUNNING in non-mass
# tickets (i.e., the legal department will decide whether to shift the ticket
# to the delegation stage). Same for RC_MANUAL. I.e., set the tx status only
# to TXS_ERROR if the exception indicates an RC_ERROR or an RC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
# In mass tickets, we don't want to hold up the ticket - just set the
# corresponding exception to TXS_ERROR - but only for optional exceptions.

    # Don't use get_disruptive_items() because that would weed out exceptions
    # marked with is_optional() as well. But even optional exceptions should
    # cause a TXS_ERROR, if they aren't RC_OK.
