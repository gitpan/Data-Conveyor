# ABSTRACT: Stage-based conveyor-belt-like ticket handling system

#
# Contains a list of other result objects, which can include other
# containers, since they derive from the same subclass as "normal" service
# result objects such as scalars and tables.
use YAML;
use parent 'Data::Conveyor::Service::Result';

# don't subclass Data::Container, since we have a slightly different API - we
# use 'result' instead of 'items', for example.

# concatenate the stringifications of the result list
sub result_as_string {
    my $self = shift;
    join "\n" => map { "$_" } $self->result;
}

# Here exception() is a method, not an attribute. You can't set an exception
# on a container directly; rather, if elements of the result list have
# exceptions, they will be returned in an exception container. If there are no
# exceptions in the results, undef will be returned.
