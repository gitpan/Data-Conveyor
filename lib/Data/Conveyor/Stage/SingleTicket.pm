# ABSTRACT: Stage-based conveyor-belt-like ticket handling system

# Base class for stages handling a single ticket (i.e., policy or delegation,
# but not queue).
#
# To use it, create an object of this class, set the ticket and
# call run(). You can then read the status the stage's ticket and act on it.

    # Remember the log's previous max_level settings and temporarily (until
    # the end of the ticket stage) set the log's max_level to the one
    # indicated by the ticket. This mechanism can be used to increase a faulty
    # ticket's log level from the regsh so that verbose information can be
    # seen in the log. But only override with the ticket's log level if it is
    # higher than the current log level; we don't want a ticket to actually
    # reduce the current log level.
