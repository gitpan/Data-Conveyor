            # The transaction handler will accumulate exceptions in the
            # exception container of the payload item pointed to by the
            # current transaction.
            #
            # Transaction handlers can ask for extra tx to be run by further
            # stages.  For example, the policy transaction handler for
            # person.update can, when asked to modify otherwise immutable
            # owner fields, downgrade an owner to a contact when that owner
            # isn't used in a delegation. To do so, it adds a
            # person.set-contact tx so that the delegation can downgrade the
            # person.
            #
            # Transaction handlers do so via an extra_tx_list attribute, which
            # is processed here. We don't just push onto
            # $self->ticket->payload->transactions because we are iterating
            # over just that, and it's not recommended to change a list while
            # iterating over it.
            #
            # A null transaction handler - produced by a Class::Null entry in
            # the relevant hashes of the transaction factory - returns another
            # Class::Null object on each of its method calls, so here we'd be
            # pushing a Class::Null object onto @extra_tx. Avoid that.
            if ($transaction_handler->extra_tx_list_count) {
