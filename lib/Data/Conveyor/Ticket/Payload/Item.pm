# For rc() and status(), we pass the payload item's owning ticket object to
# the exception container. The container needs to ask the ticket whether to
# ignore an exception. Why do the payload object and the payload items have an
# owning ticket, but the exception container does not? Because exception
# containers are filled from various places, and are passed around. In
# contrast, payload containers and payload items are always tied to a ticket.
#
# We also pass the payload item itself because it will eventually be passed to
# the exception handler, which uses it to decide the rc and status of each
# exception it is ask to handle. That is, the rc and exception aren't
# determined by the exception type alone. The same exception can have
# different rc and status values depending on which object type and command it
# is associated with.
