# ABSTRACT: Stage-based conveyor-belt-like ticket handling system

# Base class for classes operating on transactions. Policy and delegation
# classes subclass this class.
use Error::Hierarchy::Util 'assert_defined';
use parent 'Class::Scaffold::Storable';
__PACKAGE__->mk_framework_object_accessors(
    ticket              => 'ticket',
    transaction_factory => 'factory',
)->mk_scalar_accessors(qw(tx stage))->mk_array_accessors(qw(extra_tx_list));

# ticket and tx are passed by Data::Conveyor::Transaction::Factory
# constructor call; the factory also passes itself as the factory
# attribute so the transaction can ask the factory to construct
# further objects.
# shortcuts to the item and its data referenced by the current transaction
sub payload_item      { $_[0]->tx->transaction->payload_item }
sub payload_item_data { $_[0]->payload_item->data }

# Cumulate exceptions here and throw them summarily in an exception container
# at the end. We do this because we want to be able to check as much as
# possible.
sub record {
    my $self = shift;

    # make record() invisible to caller when reporting exception location
    local $Error::Depth = $Error::Depth + 1;
    $self->payload_item->exception_container->record(@_,
        is_optional => $self->tx->transaction->is_optional,);
}

# Like record(), but records an actual exception object. This method would be
# called if you want to record an exception caught from somewhere else.
