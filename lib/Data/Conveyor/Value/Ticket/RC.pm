# Apply a new rc to the value object's existing rc. When called by the payload
# methods this method makes sure that the resulting rc is the worst of all
# exception's associated rc's. That is, if there are only exceptions with
# RC_ERROR, the whole ticket will have RC_ERROR as its rc. But if one of those
# exceptions is associated with RC_INTERNAL_ERROR, the whole ticket will have
# RC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
#
# We use an op table for "$ticket_rc * $rc". Here, 'OK' stands for
# 'RC_OK', 'ERR' for 'RC_ERROR' and 'INT' for 'RC_INTERNAL_ERROR'.

# The following simple code relies on the fact that RC_* are encoded as
# numbers that increase with increasing severity. If that premise doesn't
# hold anymore, we'll probably have to implement a real ops table.
